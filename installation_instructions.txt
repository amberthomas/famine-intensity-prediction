PYTHON VERSION:
I worked almost entirely in python 3.7 and I am fairly certain that 3.5
will work just fine. 

INSTALLATION:
I first recommend running the amber_setup.sh script, which should pip 
install all the required packages (hopefully).

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
The only difficulties with installing were google
earth engine (though following the GEE instruction sheet worked fine 
for me) and GDAL. I had to install gdal with homebrew. Additionally
I had some issues with the google API certs (security) packages until I 
upgraded to 3.7 (if I recall correctly it was the urlib or urlib2 library
causing issues).
