I believe that all requirements to run are covered by the amber setup.txt for the modis model. 
hopefully I have the correct pip version of cv2

Jaspreet, I believe has her own set of requirements, such as pomegranate.
Otherwise the only req's are python 3, GDAL and GEE.

PLEASE NOTE:
That Jaspreet has all of her files in /acled_visualization/HMM_FAM/. Amber attempted to integrate 
 the two set-up, but if there are issues see Jaspreet's original files.
