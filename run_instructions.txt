To run the code first run amber_setup.sh, (should install Jaspreet's as well)
and then just run main.sh

*remember you may need to chmod +x 'shell script'*

The script should prompt you for input as required. 

I also encourage you to look at either the provided jupyter notebooks or 
the provided pdf outputs of the note books, incase the figures fail to 
display properly.

PLEASE NOTE:
That Jaspreet has all of her files in /acled_visualization/HMM_FAM/. Amber attempted to integrate 
 the two set-up, but if there are issues see Jaspreet's original files.
